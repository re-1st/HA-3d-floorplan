This is the configuration of my Smart Home dashboard in Home Assistant, which I have displayed on a wall-mounted tablet. For a demonstration, watch this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKh0s9z--c

Please be aware that some of the functionality shown in this video may differ from what is configured in the latest version of my repository

My goal is to inspire others to create their own 3D floorplans and delve into the possibilities of home automation. I learned a lot from the floorplan config of Luke Vink. you should checkout his repo first:

**Disclaimer**:  I am  a hobbyist with no programming background. The day I started this project i had never opened a yaml file or skecthup project.  While this  may be encouraging for other non-skilled people trying to build their own floorplan,  I am certain that much of my YAML, CSS, JSON, etc., could be constructed better or more efficiently.  I welcome any suggestions that could improve my work. 

I've made this repository available to offer a comprehensive overview of my Smart Home configuration in Home Assistant. It can serve as a guide for those looking to build their own dashboard. However, as much of the configuration relies on custom integrations, simply copying the entire code may not yield identical results. If any part of this configuration is unclear or requires further explanation, please do not hesitate to reach out.

**Updates**
13-03-2024: I'm changing my light pop-ups with the custom 'more-info card'. Despite it is a custom card It is standard HA functionality and it has way better responsiveness when used on a tabletm than all other cards I tested.
